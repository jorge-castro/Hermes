Hermes is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot that provides data on different financial assets.
It sources data directly from the [Coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) via [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

Hermes leverages [Zappa](https://github.com/zappa/Zappa) for easy deployment to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

You can find the original instance of Hermes as @hermes\_the\_greek\_bot, feel free to deploy your own!
